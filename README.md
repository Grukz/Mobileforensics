# Mobileforensics

Python scripts for doing live forensic acquisitions in Mobile environments.

This is a work in progress to create a modular framework that you can easily add new functions while keeping the script mostly self-contained and easy to run with minimal impact on the host.

Arff.py is the Android version, iarrf.py is the IOS version

Not all functions are 100% tested, but exist to show potential capabilities or spark additional ideas.

Thanks for your interest!
